# Lemma

Verified query synthesis: SQL is transpiled to a Dafny spec, an agent (or mock) writes an optimized `RunQuery`, Dafny/Z3 proves correctness, and the result is compiled to native Rust. Contains DuckDB extension, where Optimized binaries are cached and invoked when rerun.

## What It Does

1. A SQL query is **deterministically transpiled** into a mathematical `MethodSpec` in Dafny — the ground truth.
2. The Lemma optimizer uses an agent (or mock mode) to write an optimized `method RunQuery`.
3. Dafny/Z3 formally proves that the agent's output satisfies `MethodSpec`.
4. The verified Dafny is translated to Rust and post-processed for native performance.*
5. The code is compiled and executed.
6. Successful optimized binaries are **cached** and loaded via the DuckDB extension.

* Post-processing rewrites are trusted to match verified Dafny semantics; see `research_loop/COMPILATION_GUIDE.md`.

## Quick Start with DuckDB extension

```bash
make install
make extension
./run_duckdb_and_load_extension_and_sbb_dataset.sh
# In the shell:
# SELECT lemma('SELECT SUM(LO_EXTENDEDPRICE * LO_DISCOUNT) FROM lineorder_flat WHERE ...');
```

Interactive demo (clears cache, seeds mock body, opens DuckDB CLI): `./scripts/demo.sh`

### Requirements
- [uv](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/) — Python package manager
- [Dafny 4.x](https://github.com/dafny-lang/dafny) — in `PATH`
- [Rust/Cargo](https://rustup.rs/) — for native compilation
- [DuckDB CLI](https://duckdb.org/) — vendored to `build/duckdb` on first launcher run
